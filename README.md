# CS-350-OS-Project

This is our project for the operating systems course. It is about filesystems, we implemented a code that can check 
the sizes of the files in a given directory. Then compare them based on spesific sizes and plot them in a histogram.
More spesifics about our plan can be seen in the presentation. The second task was to transfer the files from any directory to another directory.
Our inspiration came from hybrid drives that can look at the files sizes and organizes them. For example, if some file is larger than 1 GB put 
this file in the hard drive, else put them in the SSD. We implemented a solution using python. Also we made a PDF (Probability Distribution Function),
and a CDF (Cumultaive Distribution function) with the data that we acquired from the given directory.
